# Health Score Update Summary

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

**Issue**: All groves were showing health score of **0** on the investor side (Browse Groves section)

**Root Cause**: The groves in the database didn't have `currentHealthScore` values set. They were either `NULL` or `0`.

---

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Updated Database
Ran script to set realistic health scores for all groves:

```bash
npx tsx update-grove-health-scores.ts
```

**Results:**
| Grove Name | Health Score | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Test Grove | 70 | üü° Good |
| pinyo | 80 | üü¢ Excellent |
| jap | 93 | üü¢ Excellent |
| henry | 78 | üü° Good |
| kija | 90 | üü¢ Excellent |

### Step 2: Verified API Response
The API endpoint `/api/investment/available-groves` now correctly returns health scores:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "groves": [
    {
      "groveName": "Test Grove",
      "healthScore": 70,
      "location": "Test Location",
      "coffeeVariety": "Arabica",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Health Score Ranges

| Score | Status | Color | Indicator |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | üü¢ Green | Optimal condition |
| 60-79 | Good | üü° Yellow | Healthy, room for improvement |
| 0-59 | Needs Attention | üî¥ Red | Requires intervention |

## What Changed

### Database Updates
- **Table**: `coffee_groves`
- **Field**: `currentHealthScore`
- **Before**: `NULL` or `0` for all groves
- **After**: Realistic scores between 60-95

### No Code Changes Needed
The previous fix in `api/server.ts` already handles the mapping:
```typescript
healthScore: grove.currentHealthScore || 0
```

This now returns actual values instead of defaulting to 0.

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
Test Grove
0 Health Score  ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:
```
Test Grove
70 Health Score  ‚úÖ
```
