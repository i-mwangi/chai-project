# Restart Servers to Apply Fixes

## The Fix

I've updated the frontend mock server to properly proxy investment API calls to the real backend using Node.js's built-in `http` module instead of `fetch` (which may not be available in your Node.js version).

## Steps to Apply the Fix

### 1. Stop the Frontend Mock Server

Find the terminal/process running the frontend server and stop it:
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
- Or kill the process on port 3002

### 2. Restart the Frontend Mock Server

```bash
node frontend/api-server.js
```

### 3. Verify Both Servers are Running

```bash
npx tsx check-servers.ts
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Backend API Server is running on port 3001
âœ… Frontend Mock Server is running on port 3002
```

### 4. Test the Fix

```bash
npx tsx debug-portfolio.ts
```

You should now see:
```
ðŸ“Š Analysis:
âœ… SUCCESS: Purchase is in both backend database and frontend!
```

## What Changed

**Before:**
- Frontend mock server tried to use `fetch()` which wasn't available
- Fell back to mock implementation (in-memory storage)
- Purchases weren't saved to database

**After:**
- Frontend mock server uses Node.js `http` module
- Successfully proxies to backend API
- Purchases are saved to database
- Portfolio shows real data

## Verification

After restarting, test in your browser:

1. **Register a grove** (as farmer)
2. **Purchase tokens** (as investor)
3. **Check portfolio** - you should now see your purchase!

The purchase will:
- âœ… Be stored in the SQLite database
- âœ… Persist across server restarts
- âœ… Show up in portfolio immediately
- âœ… Be available for revenue distributions

## Troubleshooting

If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check console logs** - The frontend server now logs proxy attempts:
   ```
   [PROXY] Forwarding purchase request to backend: http://localhost:3001/api/investment/purchase-tokens
   [PROXY] Backend response: 200 SUCCESS
   ```

2. **Verify backend is responding**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

3. **Check if ports are correct**:
   - Backend should be on port 3001
   - Frontend mock should be on port 3002

4. **Clear browser cache** and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Success!

Once you see the proxy logs showing successful backend communication, your primary market investments will be fully functional with database persistence! ðŸŽ‰
