# Marketplace: "Cannot Buy Your Own Listing" ✅

## This is CORRECT Behavior!

The error message "Cannot buy your own listing" is a **security feature**, not a bug.

## Why This Restriction Exists

### Prevents:
1. **Price Manipulation** - Can't artificially inflate prices
2. **Fake Volume** - Can't create fake trading activity
3. **Self-Dealing** - Can't trade with yourself
4. **Wash Trading** - Illegal in real markets

### Real-World Example:
```
❌ You can't buy your own house listing on Zillow
❌ You can't buy your own eBay auction
❌ You can't buy your own stock on NYSE
✅ Someone else must buy it
```

## How Marketplace Works

### Correct Flow:

**Investor A (Seller):**
1. Owns 10 tokens in Grove X
2. Lists 5 tokens for $30 each
3. Waits for buyer

**Investor B (Buyer):**
1. Browses marketplace
2. Sees Investor A's listing
3. Buys 5 tokens for $30 each ✅
4. Now owns 5 tokens

**Result:**
- Investor A: Has 5 tokens left, received $150
- Investor B: Has 5 tokens, paid $150

### Incorrect Flow (Blocked):

**Investor A:**
1. Lists 5 tokens for sale
2. Tries to buy own listing ❌
3. Gets error: "Cannot buy your own listing"

## Testing Marketplace

### Option 1: Use Two Browser Profiles

**Profile 1 (Seller):**
```
1. Open Chrome
2. Connect wallet: 0.0.789012
3. List tokens for sale
```

**Profile 2 (Buyer):**
```
1. Open Chrome Incognito
2. Connect different wallet: 0.0.123456
3. Buy from marketplace
```

### Option 2: Use Two Different Wallets

**Wallet 1:**
- Address: 0.0.789012
- Role: Seller
- Action: List tokens

**Wallet 2:**
- Address: 0.0.123456  
- Role: Buyer
- Action: Buy tokens

### Option 3: Cancel and Re-buy Primary

If you just want to test:
```
1. Cancel your marketplace listing
2. Go back to Browse Groves
3. Buy more tokens from primary market
```

## What You Can Do

### As a Seller:
✅ List your tokens for sale  
✅ Set your own price  
✅ Set expiration date  
✅ Cancel your listing  
✅ Update listing price  
❌ Buy your own listing  

### As a Buyer:
✅ Browse marketplace listings  
✅ Buy from other investors  
✅ See listing details  
✅ Compare prices  
❌ Buy your own listings  

## Marketplace vs Primary Market

- Fixed price (currently $25)
- Reduces "Tokens Available"
- Anyone can buy

### Secondary Market (Marketplace):

- No new tokens issued
- Variable prices (set by sellers)
- Ownership transfers
- Can't buy your own
