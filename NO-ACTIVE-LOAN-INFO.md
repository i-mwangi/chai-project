# "No Active Loan Found" - This is Normal! ✅

## What This Message Means

The error message:
```
Error: No active loan found
```

Is **NOT actually an error** - it simply means you don't currently have any active loans, which is perfectly normal!

## Why You See It

When you navigate to the **Lending** section, the system checks:
1. Do you have any active loans?
2. If yes → Show loan details
3. If no → Show "Take Loan" option

The "No active loan found" message appears because you haven't taken out a loan yet.

## The Fix

Changed the error handling to treat "No active loan" as a normal state instead of an error:

```javascript
// Before: Logged as error
console.error('Failed to load active loan:', error);

// After: Recognized as normal
if (error.message.includes('No active loan')) {
    console.log('No active loan - this is normal');
    // Hide active loan container
    // Show take loan options
}
```

3. **Enter amount** (e.g., $1,000)
4. **Provide collateral** (your tokens)

## Status After Fix

✅ **Fixed** - "No active loan" no longer shows as error  
✅ **Normal** - Treated as expected state  
✅ **Clean Console** - No error messages for normal state  

## Summary

- **"No active loan found"** = You don't have a loan (this is normal!)
- **Not an error** = Just means lending is available
- **Fixed** = Now handled gracefully without error messages
- **You're good!** = Everything is working correctly

The console will now show:
```

```

Instead of:
```
❌ Failed to load active loan: Error: No active loan found
```
