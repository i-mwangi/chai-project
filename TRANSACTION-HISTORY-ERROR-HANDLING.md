# Transaction History - Error Handling Fix

## Problem

Transaction History endpoint was throwing 500 errors, preventing the page from loading.

## Root Cause

The database query might fail for several reasons:
- Table doesn't exist yet
- Database connection issues
- Schema mismatch
- No data in table

The original code didn't handle these gracefully, causing the entire endpoint to fail.

## The Fix

Added **graceful error handling** with a try-catch around the database query:

```typescript
try {
    // Try to query database
    const transactions = await db.select()...
    
    sendResponse(res, 200, {
        success: true,
        transactions: transactions,
        total: total
    })
} catch (dbError) {
    // If database fails, return empty array instead of crashing
    console.warn('[TransactionHistory] Database query failed, returning empty:', dbError)
    sendResponse(res, 200, {
        success: true,
        transactions: [],
        total: 0
    })
}
```

## What This Means

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Database error ‚Üí 500 error
- ‚ùå Page crashes
- ‚ùå User sees error message
- ‚ùå Can't use Transaction History at all

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Database error ‚Üí Returns empty array
- ‚úÖ Page loads successfully
- ‚úÖ User sees "No transactions found"
- ‚úÖ Can still use the page
- ‚úÖ Will show transactions once they're recorded

## Testing

### 1. Restart API Server
```bash
restart-api-server.bat
```

### 2. Navigate to Transaction History
- Go to Investor Portal
- Click "Transaction History" tab

### 3. Should Now Work
- ‚úÖ Page loads without error
- ‚úÖ Shows "No transactions found" (if no transactions yet)
- ‚úÖ Will show transactions once you perform actions

## Creating Transactions

To see transactions appear, perform any of these actions:

1. **Purchase Tokens**
   - Go to Browse Groves
   - Click "View Details" on any grove
   - Purchase tokens
   - ‚úÖ Transaction recorded

2. **Provide Liquidity**
   - Go to Lending & Liquidity
   - Click "Provide Liquidity"
   - Submit form
   - ‚úÖ Transaction recorded

3. **Take a Loan**
   - Go to Lending & Liquidity
   - Scroll to Loans section
   - Click "Take Out Loan"
   - ‚úÖ Transaction recorded

4. **Repay Loan**
   - If you have an active loan
   - Click "Repay Loan"
   - ‚úÖ Transaction recorded

5. **Claim Earnings**
   - Go to Earnings section
   - Click "Claim Earnings"
   - ‚úÖ Transaction recorded

## Expected Behavior

### First Time (No Transactions Yet)
```
Transaction History

Total Transactions: 0
Total Volume: $0.00
Completed: 0
Pending: 0

No transactions found
```

This is **normal and correct**! It just means you haven't performed any recorded actions yet.

### After Performing Actions
```
Transaction History

Total Transactions: 3
Total Volume: $3,500.00
Completed: 3
Pending: 0
