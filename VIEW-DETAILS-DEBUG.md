# View Details Button Debug

## Status
- ✅ "Invest Now" button works
- ❌ "View Details" button not working

## Changes Made

### Added Error Handling
Wrapped the modal creation in try-catch to catch any JavaScript errors that might prevent the modal from showing.

### Added Detailed Logging
Console logs now show:
1. When viewGroveDetails is called
2. Available grove IDs
3. Which grove was found
4. When modal is appended to body
5. When event listeners are attached
6. Any errors during modal creation

## What to Check in Browser Console

When you click "View Details", you should see:

```
[InvestorPortal] View Details clicked for grove: 1
[InvestorPortal] viewGroveDetails called with groveId: 1
[InvestorPortal] Available groves: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[InvestorPortal] Opening details for grove: Test Grove
[InvestorPortal] Modal appended to body
[InvestorPortal] Modal event listeners attached
```

## Possible Issues

### 1. Modal Not Visible (CSS Issue)
If the console shows the modal was created but you don't see it:
- Check if `.modal.active` CSS is correct
- Check z-index values
- Look for `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`

### 2. JavaScript Error
If you see an error in console:
- Check which line is failing
- Might be undefined property (healthScore, pricePerToken, etc.)

### 3. Modal Closes Immediately
If modal appears and disappears:
- Event bubbling issue
- Check if click event is propagating to backdrop

### 4. Button Click Not Registering
If you don't see the first console log:
- Event listener not attached
- Button element not found
- Another element blocking the click

## Quick Test

Run this in browser console after clicking "View Details":
```javascript
// Check if modal exists in DOM
console.log('Modals in DOM:', document.querySelectorAll('.modal').length);

// Check if modal is visible
const modal = document.querySelector('.modal.active');
if (modal) {
    console.log('Modal found:', modal);
    console.log('Modal display:', window.getComputedStyle(modal).display);
    console.log('Modal z-index:', window.getComputedStyle(modal).zIndex);
    console.log('Modal opacity:', window.getComputedStyle(modal).opacity);
} else {
    console.log('No active modal found');
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart frontend**: `restart-frontend-server.bat`
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Click "View Details"**
4. **Copy all console output** and share it

This will help identify exactly where the issue is occurring.
