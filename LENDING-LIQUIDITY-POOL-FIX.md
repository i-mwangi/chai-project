# Lending Liquidity Pool Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pool Statistics Response Structure Mismatch
**Problem:** The backend was returning pool data in a `data` property, but the frontend expected it in a `pool` property.

**Error:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'assetName')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'totalLiquidity')
```

**Fix:** Updated `api/lending-api.ts` in the `getPoolStatistics` method to return:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  pool: stats  // Changed from 'data' to 'pool'
}
```

### 2. Missing Provider Address Parameter
**Problem:** The frontend API was not sending the required `providerAddress` parameter when calling provide/withdraw liquidity endpoints.

**Error:**
```
POST http://localhost:3001/api/lending/provide-liquidity 400 (Bad Request)
Error: Missing required parameters: assetAddress, amount, providerAddress
```

**Fix:** Updated `frontend/js/api.js` to include the provider address from the wallet:
- `provideLiquidity()` now gets the address from `window.walletManager.getAccountId()`
- `withdrawLiquidity()` now gets the address from `window.walletManager.getAccountId()`
- Both methods throw an error if wallet is not connected

### 3. Incorrect Liquidity Validation Logic
**Problem:** The `provideLiquidity` endpoint was checking if the amount exceeded available liquidity, which doesn't make sense when adding liquidity to a pool.

**Fix:** Removed the incorrect validation and instead updated the pool statistics to reflect the added liquidity:
```javascript
pool.totalLiquidity += amount
pool.availableLiquidity += amount
pool.totalLPTokens += amount
```

### 4. Response Structure Inconsistency
**Problem:** The `provideLiquidity` response was wrapping data in a `data` property, inconsistent with other endpoints.

**Fix:** Flattened the response structure to return data directly at the top level:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  assetAddress,
  amount,
  lpTokensMinted,
  transactionHash,
  providedAt
}
```

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Restart the API server:
   ```
   restart-api-server.bat
   ```

2. Restart the frontend server:
   ```
   restart-frontend-server.bat
   ```

3. Navigate to the Investor Portal > Lending section

4. Click "Provide Liquidity" on any pool

5. Enter an amount and submit the form

6. Verify:
   - Pool details load correctly in the modal
   - Liquidity calculations update as you type
   - Form submission succeeds without errors
   - Success message appears
   - Pool statistics update to reflect the new liquidity

## Files Modified

- `api/lending-api.ts` - Fixed response structures and validation logic
- `frontend/js/api.js` - Added provider address parameter to liquidity methods
