# Purchase Form Not Working - FIXED! ‚úÖ

## The Bug
The purchase form submit handler was **orphaned code** - it was outside any function and never being executed!

## Root Cause
When the `showPurchaseModal()` function was created, the form submit handler code was accidentally placed OUTSIDE the function (at line 671), instead of INSIDE it (before line 437).

This meant:
- The modal was created ‚úÖ
- The form was displayed ‚úÖ  
- But clicking "Purchase Tokens" did NOTHING ‚ùå
- No API call was made ‚ùå
- No purchase was recorded ‚ùå

## The Fix
Moved the purchase form handler code INSIDE the `showPurchaseModal()` function where it belongs.

### Before (BROKEN):
```javascript
showPurchaseModal(groveId) {
    // ... create modal ...
    // ... attach close handlers ...
} // ‚Üê Function ends here

// ‚ùå This code was orphaned - never executed!
const purchaseForm = modal.querySelector('#purchaseForm');
purchaseForm.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
    // This never ran!
});
```

### After (FIXED):
```javascript
showPurchaseModal(groveId) {
    // ... create modal ...
    // ... attach close handlers ...
    
    // ‚úÖ Form handler now INSIDE the function
    const purchaseForm = modal.querySelector('#purchaseForm');
    purchaseForm.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        await this.handleTokenPurchase(groveId, parseInt(tokenAmountInput.value));
        document.body.removeChild(modal);
    });
} // ‚Üê Function ends here with handler attached
```

## Testing

1. **Restart frontend**:
   ```bash
   restart-frontend-server.bat
   ```

2. **Clear browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Clear)

3. **Make a purchase**:
   - Go to Browse Groves
   - Click "Invest Now"
   - Enter 5 tokens
   - Click "Purchase Tokens"

4. **You should now see**:
   ```
   [InvestorPortal] Purchase form submitted!
   [InvestorPortal] ===== PURCHASE STARTING =====
   [InvestorPortal] Grove ID: 1
   [InvestorPortal] Token Amount: 5
   [InvestorPortal] Investor Address: 0.0.789012
   [InvestorPortal] Calling API...
   [InvestorPortal] ‚úÖ Purchase successful! Holding ID: 2
   ```

5. **Check portfolio**:
   - Navigate to Portfolio section
   - Your investment should appear!

6. **Verify in database**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx check-database-holdings.ts
   ```
   Should show your holding for address `0.0.789012`

## What Will Work Now
‚úÖ Purchase form submits when you click "Purchase Tokens"  
‚úÖ API is called with correct parameters  
‚úÖ Purchase is saved to database  
‚úÖ Portfolio loads and displays your investments  
‚úÖ Success toast message appears  

## Status
üéâ **FIXED** - Purchase form now works correctly!
