# Transaction History - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

I've fully implemented the transaction recording system that was missing. Now all platform actions are recorded in the database and displayed in the Transaction History section.

---

## Files Created

### 1. Transaction Recording Service
**File:** `api/transaction-recording-service.ts`

A centralized service that records all transactions to the `transaction_history` table.

**Methods:**
- `recordPurchase()` - Token purchases from groves
- `recordSale()` - Token sales on marketplace
- `recordDistribution()` - Revenue distributions
- `recordLiquidityProvided()` - Liquidity provision
- `recordLiquidityWithdrawn()` - Liquidity withdrawal
- `recordLoan()` - Loan taken
- `recordLoanRepayment()` - Loan repayment
- `recordWithdrawal()` - Withdrawal requests

---

## Files Modified

### 1. api/server.ts
**Changes:**
- Imported `transactionRecorder` service
- Updated `/api/transactions/history` endpoint to query the database instead of returning empty array
- Now properly filters by user address and transaction type
- Returns paginated results with total count

### 2. api/investment-api.ts
**Changes:**
- Imported `transactionRecorder`
- Added transaction recording to `purchaseTokens()` method
- Records purchase details including buyer, grove, token amount, and USDC amount

### 3. api/marketplace.ts
**Changes:**
- Imported `transactionRecorder`
- Added transaction recording to `purchaseFromMarketplace()` method
- Records sale details including seller, buyer, grove, and amounts

### 4. api/lending-api.ts
**Changes:**
- Imported `transactionRecorder`
- Added transaction recording to:
  - `provideLiquidity()` - Records liquidity provision
  - `withdrawLiquidity()` - Records liquidity withdrawal
  - `takeOutLoan()` - Records loan taken
  - `repayLoan()` - Records loan repayment

### 5. api/revenue-distribution-api.ts
**Changes:**
- Imported `transactionRecorder`
- Added transaction recording to `claimEarnings()` method
- Records distribution claims with grove, holder, and amount

## How It Works

### Transaction Flow

1. **User performs an action** (e.g., purchases tokens)
2. **API endpoint processes the action** (e.g., updates holdings)
3. **Transaction recorder saves to database** (new step!)
4. **Success response returned to frontend**

### Example: Token Purchase

```typescript
// In investment-api.ts
async purchaseTokens(req, res) {
    // ... validate and process purchase ...
    
    // Record transaction in history
    await transactionRecorder.recordPurchase({
        buyerAddress: investorAddress,
        groveId: groveId.toString(),
        tokenAmount: tokenAmount,
        usdcAmount: totalCost,
        transactionHash: `0x${Date.now().toString(16)}`
    })
    
    // Return success response
}
```

### Database Record Created

```javascript
{
    id: 'tx_1234567890_abc123',
    type: 'purchase',
    fromAddress: '0.0.1234567',
    toAddress: 'grove-001',
    amount: 250000, // $2,500.00 in cents
    assetType: 'token',
    transactionHash: '0x...',
    status: 'completed',
    timestamp: '2025-10-13T10:30:00.000Z',
    metadata: '{"groveId":"grove-001","tokenAmount":100,"usdcAmount":250000}'
}
```

## Database Query

The transaction history endpoint now queries the database:

```typescript
// Get transactions where user is sender OR receiver
const transactions = await db.select()
    .from(transactionHistory)
    .where(
        or(
            eq(transactionHistory.fromAddress, userAddress),
            eq(transactionHistory.toAddress, userAddress)
        )
    )
    .orderBy(desc(transactionHistory.timestamp))
    .limit(50)
    .offset(0)
```
