# Performance Testing and Optimization

This directory contains performance optimization tests and documentation for the Coffee Tree Platform.

## Overview

The performance optimization work focuses on two main areas:
1. **Caching Optimization** - Reducing API calls through intelligent caching
2. **UI/UX Refinements** - Ensuring responsive design, loading states, error handling, and accessibility

## Test Suites

### 1. Cache Verification Tests
**File:** `cache-verification.spec.ts`

Tests cache configuration and timeout values for all modules:
- Price data caching (5 minutes)
- Balance data caching (30 seconds)
- Distribution history caching (1 hour)
- Pool statistics caching (2 minutes)
- Token management caching (2 minutes)

**Run tests:**
```bash
npm test tests/Performance/cache-verification.spec.ts -- --run
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 9 tests passing
- All cache timeouts verified
- API call reduction documented

---

### 2. UI/UX Verification Tests
**File:** `ui-ux-verification.spec.ts`

Tests UI/UX implementation and accessibility:
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Error message clarity
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast
- Form accessibility

**Run tests:**
```bash
npm test tests/Performance/ui-ux-verification.spec.ts -- --run
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 46 tests passing
- All responsive breakpoints verified
- Accessibility features verified

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing
If tests fail, check:
1. All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
2. Node version compatible (v16+)
3. No syntax errors in test files

### Cache Not Working
If caching doesn't seem to work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify cache timeout values in code
3. Check if cache is being cleared prematurely

### UI Issues
If UI doesn't look right:
1. Check browser compatibility
2. Verify CSS is loading correctly
3. Test on different screen sizes
4. Check browser console for errors
