# End-to-End Integration Tests

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for the Coffee Platform Missing Features implementation. These tests verify complete user workflows and cross-module interactions to ensure all platform components work together seamlessly.

## Test Structure

### Task 31.1: Complete User Workflows

**File:** `complete-user-workflows.spec.ts`

Tests complete user journeys through the platform:

#### 1. Investor Journey: Browse → Purchase → View Earnings → Claim
- **Step 1:** Browse available groves with details (variety, grade, APY)
- **Step 2:** Purchase tokens with validation
- **Step 3:** View portfolio and earnings calculations
- **Step 4:** Claim earnings with balance updates
- **Verification:** Complete journey with ROI calculation

**Test Scenario:**
```
Initial Balance: $50,000 USDC
Investment: $20,000 (200 tokens @ $100)
Harvest Revenue: $30,000
Investor Share: 70% = $21,000
Individual Earnings: $840 (4% of tokens)
Final Balance: $30,840
ROI: 4.2%
```

#### 2. Farmer Journey: Register → Report Harvest → Withdraw Revenue
- **Step 1:** Farmer verification and grove registration
- **Step 2:** Harvest reporting with pricing oracle integration
- **Step 3:** Revenue balance display
- **Step 4:** Revenue withdrawal with validation
- **Verification:** Complete journey with withdrawal tracking

**Test Scenario:**
```
Grove: Rodriguez Family Farm (250 trees)
Harvest: 1,250 kg @ $11.50/kg (oracle-validated)
Total Revenue: $14,375
Farmer Share: 30% = $4,312.50
Withdrawal: $4,000
Remaining: $312.50
Withdrawal Rate: 92.75%
```

#### 3. Admin Journey: Mint Tokens → Grant KYC → Monitor Holders
- **Step 1:** Admin role and permissions verification
- **Step 2:** Token minting operations
- **Step 3:** KYC grant to multiple investors
- **Step 4:** Token holder monitoring
- **Step 5:** KYC revocation for non-compliance
- **Verification:** Complete journey with operation tracking

**Test Scenario:**
```
Initial Supply: 1,000 tokens
Tokens Minted: 500
New Supply: 1,500 tokens
KYC Granted: 3 accounts
KYC Revoked: 1 account
Total Holders: 15
```

#### 4. Cross-Journey Integration
- Verifies all user journeys work together seamlessly
- Tests revenue flow across all roles
- Validates platform health and consistency

---

### Task 31.2: Cross-Module Interactions

**File:** `cross-module-interactions.spec.ts`

Tests interactions between different platform modules:

#### 1. Harvest Reporting with Pricing Oracle Integration
- Fetch variety-specific prices (Arabica, Robusta, Specialty, Organic)
- Apply seasonal multipliers to base prices
- Calculate projected revenue with all pricing factors
- Validate harvest prices against oracle bounds (50%-200%)
- Reject invalid prices outside acceptable range
- Create harvest reports with oracle-validated pricing

**Test Scenario:**
```
Variety: ARABICA
Grade: 8
Base Price: $10/kg
Seasonal Multiplier: 1.2x (March)
Final Price: $12/kg
Yield: 1,500 kg
Projected Revenue: $18,000
Validation: Within 50%-200% range ✓
```

#### 2. Distribution with Balance Updates
- Create distribution from harvest (70/30 split)
- Calculate holder shares proportionally
- Update balances immediately after claim
- Refresh balance within 5 seconds of transaction
- Cache balance data for 30 seconds
- Retry balance fetch up to 3 times on failure
- Update all holder balances after distribution

**Test Scenario:**
```
Total Revenue: $17,250
Farmer Share: $5,175 (30%)
Investor Share: $12,075 (70%)
Holders: 3 (100, 200, 300 tokens)
Individual Shares: $1,207.50, $2,415, $3,622.50
Balance Refresh: < 5 seconds
Cache TTL: 30 seconds
```

#### 3. Loan Health Monitoring with Price Changes
- Calculate initial loan health factor
- Update health factor when collateral price changes
- Trigger warning when health factor < 1.2
- Trigger liquidation alert when health factor < 1.0
- Monitor multiple loans with price oracle integration
- Update loan health in real-time with price changes
- Integrate price oracle updates with loan monitoring

**Test Scenario:**
```
Loan Amount: $8,000
Collateral: 100 tokens @ $100 = $10,000
Collateralization: 125%
Initial Health: 1.125

Price Changes:
- $100 → Health: 1.125 (Healthy)
- $95 → Health: 1.069 (Warning)
- $90 → Health: 1.0125 (Warning)
- $85 → Health: 0.956 (Critical - Liquidation Risk)
```

#### 4. Multi-Module Integration Scenarios
- Harvest → Distribution → Balance Update flow
- Price Change → Loan Health → Notification flow
- Data consistency verification across all modules
