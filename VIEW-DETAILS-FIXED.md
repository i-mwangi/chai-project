# View Details Button - FIXED! ✅

## The Problem
The "View Details" button was showing a toast message instead of opening the modal with grove details.

## Root Cause
There were **TWO** `viewGroveDetails()` methods in the investor-portal.js file:

1. **Line 439** - The correct method that creates and shows the modal with full grove details
2. **Line 1450** - A duplicate stub method that only showed a toast message

JavaScript uses the last defined method, so the stub at line 1450 was overwriting the proper implementation at line 439.

## The Fix
Removed the duplicate stub method at line 1450.

## Code Removed
```javascript
// REMOVED THIS DUPLICATE:
viewGroveDetails(groveId) {
    const grove = this.availableGroves.find(g => g.id === groveId);
    if (!grove) return;
    window.walletManager.showToast(`Grove details for ${grove.groveName}`, 'success');
}
```

## Testing
1. Restart frontend: `restart-frontend-server.bat`
2. Navigate to Investor Dashboard → Browse Groves
3. Click "View Details" on any grove
4. **Expected**: Modal opens showing:
   - Grove name, location, coffee variety
   - Number of trees, expected yield
   - Health score
   - Tokens available, price per token
   - Projected annual return
   - Close and "Invest Now" buttons

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - View Details button now opens the full modal with grove information
✅ **WORKING** - Invest Now button opens purchase modal
