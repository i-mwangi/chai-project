# Portfolio Investment Display - FIXED! ✅

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Missing Investor Address in Purchase ✅
**Issue**: Token purchases weren't recording the investor address  
**Fix**: Added `investorAddress` parameter to `purchaseTokens()` API call  
**File**: `frontend/js/investor-portal.js` line 685

### 2. Wrong Property Names in Portfolio Display ✅  
**Issue**: `renderHoldings()` was trying to access properties that don't exist  
**Fix**: Changed to use calculated local variables instead of non-existent holding properties  
**File**: `frontend/js/investor-portal.js` - renderHoldings() method

## Changes Made

### Before:
```javascript
<span>${holding.currentWorth.toFixed(2)}</span>
<span>${holding.tokenAmount}</span>
<span>${holding.purchasePrice.toFixed(2)}</span>
```

### After:
```javascript
<span>$${currentWorth.toFixed(2)}</span>
<span>${tokenAmount}</span>
<span>$${purchasePrice.toFixed(2)}</span>
```

## Testing

1. **Restart frontend**:
   ```bash
   restart-frontend-server.bat
   ```

2. **Make a test purchase**:
   - Connect as investor
   - Browse Groves → Select a grove
   - Click "Invest Now"
   - Purchase tokens (e.g., 10 tokens)

3. **Check Portfolio**:
   - Navigate to Portfolio section
   - You should now see your investment!

4. **What you'll see**:
   - Grove name with health score
   - Coffee variety and location
   - Tokens owned
   - Purchase price per token
   - Total investment amount
   - Purchase date
   - Current value (same as purchase for now)

## Console Logs to Watch

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
