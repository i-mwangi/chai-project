# All Lending & Borrowing Fixes - Complete Summary

## Overview

Fixed multiple issues preventing the lending and borrowing functionality from working properly.

---

## Fix #1: Loans Section Not Visible

### Problem
The entire Loans/Borrowing section was missing from the UI.

### Cause
Missing closing `</div>` tag caused the Loans section to be trapped inside the Withdraw Liquidity Modal (which is hidden by default).

### Solution
Added the missing closing div tag in `frontend/app.html`

### File Changed
- `frontend/app.html`

---

## Fix #2: Pool Statistics Response Mismatch

### Problem
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'assetName')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'totalLiquidity')
```

### Cause
Backend returned pool data in `data` property, but frontend expected `pool` property.

### Solution
Changed backend response structure in `getPoolStatistics()` method.

**Before:**
```javascript
{ success: true, data: stats }
```

**After:**
```javascript
{ success: true, pool: stats }
```

### File Changed
- `api/lending-api.ts`

---

## Fix #3: Provide Liquidity Missing Parameters

### Problem
```
POST /api/lending/provide-liquidity 400 (Bad Request)
Error: Missing required parameters: assetAddress, amount, providerAddress
```

### Cause
Frontend wasn't sending `providerAddress` parameter.

### Solution
Updated `provideLiquidity()` method to get address from wallet manager.

### File Changed
- `frontend/js/api.js`

---

## Fix #4: Withdraw Liquidity Missing Parameters

### Problem
Same as Fix #3 but for withdrawal endpoint.

### Cause
Frontend wasn't sending `providerAddress` parameter.

### Solution
Updated `withdrawLiquidity()` method to get address from wallet manager.

### File Changed
- `frontend/js/api.js`

---

## Fix #5: Take Loan Missing Parameters

### Problem
```
POST /api/lending/take-loan 400 (Bad Request)
Error: Missing required parameters: assetAddress, loanAmount, borrowerAddress
```

### Cause
Frontend wasn't sending `borrowerAddress` parameter.

### Solution
Updated `takeOutLoan()` method to get address from wallet manager.

### File Changed
- `frontend/js/api.js`

---

## Fix #6: Repay Loan Missing Parameters

### Problem
Same as Fix #5 but for repayment endpoint.

### Cause
Frontend wasn't sending `borrowerAddress` parameter.

### Solution
Updated `repayLoan()` method to get address from wallet manager.

### File Changed
- `frontend/js/api.js`

---

## Fix #7: Incorrect Liquidity Validation

### Problem
Provide liquidity endpoint was checking if amount exceeded available liquidity (backwards logic).

### Cause
Wrong validation - when providing liquidity, you're adding to the pool, not taking from it.

### Solution
Removed incorrect validation and updated pool statistics to reflect added liquidity.

### File Changed
- `api/lending-api.ts`

---
