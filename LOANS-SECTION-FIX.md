# Loans Section Not Showing - FIXED

## Problem

The **Loans/Borrowing section was completely missing** from the Lending & Liquidity page. Users could only see:
- Available Lending Pools
- Your Liquidity Positions

But could NOT see:
- Loans section
- Take Out Loan button
- Borrowing functionality

## Root Cause

**Missing closing `</div>` tag for the Withdraw Liquidity Modal**

The HTML structure was:
```html
<div id="withdrawLiquidityModal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <div class="modal-body">
            <form>...</form>
        </div>
    </div>
<!-- MISSING: </div> to close withdrawLiquidityModal -->

<!-- Loans Section -->
<div class="loans-container">
    ...
</div>
```

Because the modal's outer `<div>` was never closed, the entire Loans section was being rendered **inside the modal**, which is hidden by default (modals only show when `.active` class is added).

## The Fix

Added the missing closing `</div>` tag:

```html
<div id="withdrawLiquidityModal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <div class="modal-body">
            <form>...</form>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>  ← ADDED THIS LINE

<!-- Loans Section -->
<div class="loans-container">
    ...
</div>
```

## What Changed

**File:** `frontend/app.html`

**Before:**
```html
                                    </form>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                          <!-- Loans Section -->
                          <div class="loans-container">
```

**After:**
```html
                                    </form>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>  ← Added closing div for modal

                        <!-- Loans Section -->
                        <div class="loans-container">
```

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Restart the frontend server:
   ```
   restart-frontend-server.bat
   ```

2. Navigate to Investor Portal → Lending & Liquidity

3. Scroll down past the lending pools and liquidity positions

4. You should now see:
   - **"Loans"** section heading
   - "Borrow against your coffee tree token holdings" subtitle
   - **Available Loan Amount** card with:
     - Your Holdings Value
     - Max Loan Amount
     - Collateralization Ratio
     - Loan Terms list
     - **"Take Out Loan" button**

## What You'll See Now

The complete Lending & Liquidity page structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Lending & Liquidity                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Available Lending Pools                │
│  [USDC Pool] [KES Pool]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your Liquidity Positions               │
│  (Your LP tokens)                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Loans ← NOW VISIBLE!                   │
│  Borrow against your coffee tree tokens │
│                                         │
│  Available Loan Amount                  │
│  Your Holdings Value: $0.00             │
│  Max Loan Amount: $0.00                 │
│  [Take Out Loan]                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why the Button Might Be Disabled

If the "Take Out Loan" button is disabled (grayed out), it's because:
- You don't have any coffee tree tokens yet
- Your holdings value is $0.00

**To enable it:**
1. Go to "Browse Groves"
2. Purchase tokens from any grove
3. Return to "Lending & Liquidity"
4. The button will now be enabled with your max loan amount calculated

## Summary

The borrowing functionality was always implemented in the code - it was just hidden inside a modal due to a missing closing tag. Now it's properly visible on the page!

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Loans section now displays correctly
