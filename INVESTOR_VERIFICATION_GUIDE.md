## Disabling KYC (Developer / Demo Mode)

If you need to disable the investor KYC flow (for demos, local testing, or environments where KYC is handled externally), the server supports an environment toggle that bypasses verification.

- **Environment variable**: `DISABLE_INVESTOR_KYC`
- **Values**: `true` or `false` (default `false`)

Behavior when enabled (`DISABLE_INVESTOR_KYC=true`):
- Document submission is optional and not required.
- Any investor `status` queries will return `verified` with `full` access.
- Submissions through the API will be auto-approved and logged as system-approved.

How to run with KYC disabled (example):

```powershell
$env:DISABLE_INVESTOR_KYC='true'; npm run start
```

Important notes:
- This mode should only be used for development, testing, or controlled demo environments.
- Disabling KYC removes AML/KYC protections and must never be used in production where regulatory compliance is required.
- Remember to set `DISABLE_INVESTOR_KYC=false` (or remove the variable) when returning to production.
