# Transaction History - Final Fix Complete! ✅

## Problem Summary

Purchases were not showing in Transaction History because:
1. ❌ The `transaction_history` table didn't exist in the database
2. ❌ The transaction recording code had schema mismatches (`assetType` vs `asset`, `new Date()` vs `Date.now()`)

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created the Database Table
Manually created the `transaction_history` table in the correct database location:
- Location: `./local-store/sqlite/sqlite.db`
- Table: `transaction_history`
- Indexes: Created for efficient querying

### 2. Fixed Schema Mismatches
Updated `api/transaction-recording-service.ts` to match the database schema:
- Changed `assetType` → `asset`
- Changed `new Date()` → `Date.now()` (for timestamp)
- All 8 transaction types fixed

### 3. Verified It Works
Ran test script that confirmed:
- ✅ Table exists
- ✅ Can insert transactions
- ✅ Can query transactions
- ✅ Transaction recording works correctly

## To See Your Transactions

### Step 1: Restart API Server
```bash
restart-api-server.bat
```

**Important:** The server MUST be restarted for the fixed code to take effect!

### Step 2: Make a NEW Purchase
The purchases you made before won't show (they used old code). Make a new purchase:

1. Go to **Browse Groves**
2. Click **"View Details"** on any grove
3. Click **"Purchase Tokens"**
4. Buy some tokens (e.g., 50 tokens)
5. Complete the purchase

### Step 3: Check Transaction History
1. Go to **Transaction History** tab
2. You should now see:
   ```
   🛒 Token Purchase
   [Grove Name]
   [Time]
   +50 tokens    -$1,250.00
   ```

## What Gets Recorded

After restarting, ALL these actions will be recorded:

1. ✅ **Token Purchases** - From Browse Groves
2. ✅ **Token Sales** - On marketplace
3. ✅ **Liquidity Provision** - To lending pools
4. ✅ **Liquidity Withdrawal** - From lending pools
5. ✅ **Loans Taken** - Borrowing against tokens
6. ✅ **Loan Repayments** - Paying back loans
7. ✅ **Revenue Distributions** - Claiming earnings
8. ✅ **Withdrawals** - Platform withdrawals

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Restart API server
- [ ] Make a new token purchase
- [ ] Go to Transaction History
- [ ] See the purchase transaction
- [ ] Try other actions (provide liquidity, take loan, etc.)
