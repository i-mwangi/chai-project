# Borrowing Section Now Visible! 🎉

## What Was Wrong

You were right - the borrowing section was **completely missing** from the UI. It wasn't a scrolling issue - it literally wasn't showing up at all.

## The Bug

A **missing closing `</div>` tag** in the HTML caused the entire Loans section to be trapped inside the "Withdraw Liquidity Modal". Since modals are hidden by default, the loans section was invisible.

## The Fix

✅ **Added the missing closing div tag** in `frontend/app.html`

The Loans section is now properly outside the modal and will be visible on the page.

## What You'll See Now

After restarting the frontend server, the Lending & Liquidity page will show:

### 1. Available Lending Pools (Top)
```
USDC Stablecoin - 8.50% APY
[Provide Liquidity]

Kenyan Shilling - 12.00% APY  
[Provide Liquidity]
```

### 2. Your Liquidity Positions (Middle)
```
Your active liquidity provisions and LP tokens
(Shows your LP tokens if you've provided liquidity)
```

### 3. **Loans Section (Bottom) ← NOW VISIBLE!**
```
Loans
Borrow against your coffee tree token holdings

Available Loan Amount
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Your Holdings Value: $0.00
Max Loan Amount: $0.00
Collateralization Ratio: 125%

Loan Terms:
• Collateral Required: 125% of loan value
• Liquidation Threshold: 90% of collateral value
• Repayment Amount: 110% of loan amount
• Interest Rate: 10% of loan amount

[Take Out Loan]  ← This button will now appear!
```
