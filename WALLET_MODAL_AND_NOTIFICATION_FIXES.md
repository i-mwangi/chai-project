# Wallet Modal and Notification Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Notification Positioning**: Notifications were appearing at the bottom left instead of the top right
2. **Wallet Modal Close Button**: The 'X' button on the wallet connection popup wasn't functional

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Notification Positioning

**File**: `frontend/css/notifications.css`

- Added `!important` flags to ensure the notification container is positioned at the top right
- Added override rules to prevent other CSS from affecting positioning
- Ensured `left: auto !important` and `bottom: auto !important` to prevent incorrect positioning

### 2. Fixed Wallet Modal Close Button

**File**: `frontend/wallet/modal.js`

- Added proper global reference assignment in `createModal()` method
- Enhanced `close()` method to properly clean up references
- Updated `render()` method to use safe references with `window.walletModal && window.walletModal.method()`
- Added proper promise rejection when connection is cancelled

**Key Changes**:
- Added `window.walletModal = this;` in `createModal()` to ensure global reference
- Updated all onclick handlers to use safe reference checking
- Enhanced `close()` method to properly reject promises and clean up references

### 3. Testing Files Created

- `frontend/wallet-modal-test.html` - For testing both fixes
- `frontend/notification-test.html` - For testing notification positioning

## How to Test

1. Open `frontend/wallet-modal-test.html` in a browser
2. Click "Open Wallet Modal" and verify:
   - The modal opens correctly
   - The 'X' button closes the modal
   - Clicking outside the modal closes it
3. Click "Show Notification" and verify:
   - The notification appears at the top right of the screen
   - It slides in smoothly and disappears after timeout

## Technical Details

### Notification Positioning Fix
The issue was caused by CSS specificity conflicts. The fix uses `!important` flags to ensure the notification container is always positioned at the top right regardless of other CSS rules.

### Wallet Modal Close Button Fix
The issue was that the onclick handlers were referencing `window.walletModal.close()` but:
1. The global reference wasn't always properly set
2. There was no null checking in the handlers
3. The close method wasn't properly rejecting promises

The fix ensures:
1. `window.walletModal` is always properly set
2. All handlers use safe reference checking with `window.walletModal && window.walletModal.method()`
3. The close method properly handles promise rejection and cleanup

## Verification

These fixes ensure that:
1. Notifications always appear at the top right of the screen
2. The wallet modal close button works correctly
3. Clicking outside the modal closes it
4. Connection cancellations are properly handled
5. Memory leaks from uncleaned references are prevented
