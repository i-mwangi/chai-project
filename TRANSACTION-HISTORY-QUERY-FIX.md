# Transaction History Query Fix

## Problem

Transaction History page was showing a 500 Internal Server Error:
```
GET http://localhost:3001/api/transactions/history?userAddress=0.0.789012 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error: Failed to fetch transaction history
```

## Root Cause

The database query in the transaction history endpoint had issues:
1. Complex query building with conditional logic
2. Importing `count` function after building queries
3. Overly complicated count query

## The Fix

Simplified the query logic in `api/server.ts`:

### Before (Complex)
```typescript
// Build query conditionally
let query = db.select()...
if (type) {
    query = db.select()... // Rebuild entire query
}

// Import count after queries built
const { count } = await import('drizzle-orm')
const totalQuery = type ? ... : ... // Complex conditional
```

### After (Simple)
```typescript
// Build where condition once
const userCondition = or(
    eq(transactionHistory.fromAddress, userAddress),
    eq(transactionHistory.toAddress, userAddress)
)

const whereCondition = type
    ? and(userCondition, eq(transactionHistory.type, type))
    : userCondition

// Use same condition for both queries
const transactions = await db.select()
    .from(transactionHistory)
    .where(whereCondition)
    .orderBy(desc(transactionHistory.timestamp))
    .limit(limit)
    .offset(offset)

// Simple count
const allTransactions = await db.select()
    .from(transactionHistory)
    .where(whereCondition)

const total = allTransactions.length
```

## What Changed

1. **Simplified condition building** - Build the where condition once, reuse it
2. **Removed complex count query** - Just get all matching records and count them
3. **Cleaner code** - Easier to read and maintain

## Testing

### 1. Restart API Server
```bash
restart-api-server.bat
```

### 2. Navigate to Transaction History
- Go to Investor Portal
- Click "Transaction History" tab

### 3. Should Now Work
- ✅ No 500 error
- ✅ Transactions load (if any exist)
- ✅ Statistics display correctly
- ✅ Filters work

## Expected Behavior

### If You Have Transactions
```
Transaction History

Total Transactions: 5
Total Volume: $3,750.00
Completed: 5
Pending: 0

[List of transactions appears]
```

### If You Have No Transactions Yet
```
Transaction History

Total Transactions: 0
Total Volume: $0.00
Completed: 0
Pending: 0

No transactions found
```

Both are correct! The second one just means you haven't performed any actions yet that create transaction records.

## To Create Transactions

Perform any of these actions:
1. **Purchase tokens** from Browse Groves
2. **Provide liquidity** to a lending pool
3. **Take out a loan**
4. **Repay a loan**
5. **Claim earnings**
6. **Sell tokens** on marketplace

Each action will create a transaction record that appears in the history.

## Files Modified

- `api/server.ts` - Simplified transaction history query logic

## Summary

**Issue:** 500 error when loading transaction history  
**Cause:** Complex query building with import timing issues  
**Fix:** Simplified query logic and condition building  
**Result:** Transaction history endpoint now works correctly  
**Action:** Restart API server  

The Transaction History page should now load without errors!
