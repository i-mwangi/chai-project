# Withdrawal System - Quick Reference

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup (Already Done ‚úÖ)
```bash
# Tables created:
‚úÖ farmer_withdrawals
‚úÖ liquidity_withdrawals
‚úÖ farmer_balances
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```env
# Add to .env file:
REVENUE_RESERVE_CONTRACT_ID=0.0.55555
LENDER_CONTRACT_ID=0.0.33333
HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.12345
HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY=your-private-key-here
HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
```bash
# Backend test
npx tsx test-withdrawal-integration.ts

# Frontend test
# Open: test-withdrawal-max-button.html in browser
```

## üìã Key Features

### 30% Withdrawal Limit
```javascript
// Automatically calculated
maxWithdrawable = availableBalance * 0.30

// Example:
Available: $1000.00
Max: $300.00 (30%)
```

### Max Button
```javascript
// Frontend usage
window.withdrawalHandler.setMaxWithdrawAmount(
    farmerAddress, 
    inputElement
)
```

### Notifications
```javascript
// Success
‚úì Withdrawal Complete
  Successfully withdrew $250.00
  [View Transaction]

// Error
‚úó Withdrawal Failed
  Withdrawal exceeds 30% limit

// Info
‚Ñπ Max Amount Set
  Maximum: $300.00 (30%)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Frontend Integration

### HTML
```html
<input type="number" id="withdrawAmount" />
<button onclick="setMaxAmount()">MAX (30%)</button>
<button onclick="withdraw()">Withdraw</button>
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
// Set max amount
async function setMaxAmount() {
    await window.withdrawalHandler.setMaxWithdrawAmount(
        farmerAddress,
        document.getElementById('withdrawAmount')
    )
}

// Process withdrawal
async function withdraw() {
    const amount = parseFloat(
        document.getElementById('withdrawAmount').value
    )
    
    const result = await window.withdrawalHandler.withdrawFarmerShare(
        farmerAddress,
        amount
    )
    
    if (result.success) {
        console.log('Withdrawal successful:', result.data)
    }
}
```

## üîç Validation Rules

### Amount Validation
```javascript
‚úì amount > 0
‚úì amount ‚â§ availableBalance
‚úì amount ‚â§ maxWithdrawable (30%)
```

### Error Messages
```javascript
"Amount must be positive"
"Insufficient balance. Available: $X.XX"
"Withdrawal exceeds 30% limit. Maximum: $X.XX"
"Revenue contract not initialized"
```

## üìä Database Schema

### farmer_balances
```sql
farmerAddress (PK)
availableBalance (cents)
pendingBalance (cents)
totalEarned (cents)
totalWithdrawn (cents)
lastWithdrawalAt (timestamp)
```

### farmer_withdrawals
```sql
id (PK)
farmerAddress
groveId (optional)
amount (cents)
status (pending/completed/failed)
transactionHash
blockExplorerUrl
errorMessage
requestedAt
completedAt
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [x] Database tables created
- [x] 30% limit enforced
- [x] Max button works
- [x] Notifications display
- [x] Balance updates
- [x] History tracked
- [ ] Hedera contracts deployed
- [ ] Environment configured
- [ ] Testnet tested
- [ ] Production deployed

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Revenue contract not initialized"
**Solution:** Set `REVENUE_RESERVE_CONTRACT_ID` in `.env`

### "Insufficient balance"
**Solution:** User needs more revenue distribution

### "Exceeds 30% limit"
**Solution:** User should withdraw less (use MAX button)

### Database errors
**Solution:** Run migration:
```bash
node -e "const sqlite3 = require('better-sqlite3'); const db = sqlite3('./local-store/sqlite/sqlite.db'); const fs = require('fs'); const sql = fs.readFileSync('./db/migrations/add-withdrawal-tables.sql', 'utf8'); db.exec(sql); db.close();"
```

## ‚úÖ Production Checklist

1. [ ] Deploy smart contracts to Hedera
2. [ ] Update `.env` with contract IDs
3. [ ] Test on Hedera testnet
4. [ ] Fund contracts with liquidity
5. [ ] Monitor withdrawal success rates
6. [ ] Set up error alerts
7. [ ] Configure rate limiting
8. [ ] Enable transaction logging
9. [ ] Test max button in production UI
10. [ ] Verify notifications work

## üéØ Key Metrics to Monitor

- Withdrawal success rate
- Average withdrawal amount
- 30% limit hit rate
- Failed transaction reasons
- Contract gas usage
- Response times

## üîê Security Notes

- All amounts validated server-side
- 30% limit enforced before contract execution
- All transactions logged in database
- Failed transactions tracked with error messages
- Transaction hashes stored for verification
- Block explorer URLs provided for transparency
