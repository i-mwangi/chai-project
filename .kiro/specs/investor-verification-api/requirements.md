# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Coffee Tree Platform currently has farmer verification functionality but lacks investor verification capabilities. The frontend investor portal is attempting to call investor verification endpoints that don't exist, resulting in 404 errors. This feature will implement a complete investor verification system that allows investors to submit verification documents, track their verification status, and access platform features based on their verification level.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to submit verification documents so that I can access investment features on the platform

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an investor submits verification documents THEN the system SHALL store the documents securely
2. WHEN an investor submits documents THEN the system SHALL validate required document types are provided
3. WHEN documents are submitted THEN the system SHALL create a verification record with pending status
4. IF required documents are missing THEN the system SHALL return validation errors
5. WHEN documents are successfully submitted THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation with tracking information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to check my verification status so that I can track the progress of my application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an investor requests their verification status THEN the system SHALL return current status and details
2. WHEN status is requested for non-existent investor THEN the system SHALL return unverified status
3. WHEN status is requested THEN the system SHALL include verification level and any pending requirements
4. WHEN status is verified THEN the system SHALL include verification date and expiry information
5. WHEN status is pending THEN the system SHALL include estimated processing time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to review and approve investor verification requests so that I can ensure compliance and security

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator reviews documents THEN the system SHALL allow approval or rejection
2. WHEN verification is approved THEN the system SHALL update status to verified with timestamp
3. WHEN verification is rejected THEN the system SHALL record rejection reason and allow resubmission
4. WHEN status changes THEN the system SHALL log the change with administrator details
5. WHEN verification expires THEN the system SHALL automatically update status to require renewal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an investor, I want different verification levels so that I can access appropriate platform features based on my verification status

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investor has basic verification THEN the system SHALL allow limited investment amounts
2. WHEN investor has full verification THEN the system SHALL allow unlimited platform access
3. WHEN investor is unverified THEN the system SHALL restrict access to investment features
4. WHEN verification level changes THEN the system SHALL update access permissions immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track verification metrics so that I can monitor the verification process effectiveness

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide verification statistics by status
2. WHEN tracking metrics THEN the system SHALL record processing times and approval rates
3. WHEN monitoring compliance THEN the system SHALL flag expired or expiring verifications
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide verification volume over time
5. WHEN auditing THEN the system SHALL maintain complete verification history logs
