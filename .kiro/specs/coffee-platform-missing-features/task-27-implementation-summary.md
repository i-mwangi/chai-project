# Task 27: Notification System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive notification system for the Coffee Tree Platform that provides user feedback for critical operations including distribution claims, withdrawals, loan health warnings, and liquidity alerts.

## Components Implemented

### 1. NotificationManager Class (`frontend/js/notification-manager.js`)

**Core Features:**
- Four notification types: success, error, warning, info
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds (configurable)
- Manual dismiss button on all notifications
- Support for notification titles
- Optional action buttons with callbacks
- Stacking notifications in top-right corner
- Smooth slide-in/slide-out animations

**Key Methods:**
```javascript
notificationManager.success(message, options)
notificationManager.error(message, options)
notificationManager.warning(message, options)
notificationManager.info(message, options)
notificationManager.dismiss(id)
notificationManager.dismissAll()
```

**Options Object:**
- `title`: Optional title for the notification
- `autoDismiss`: Boolean to enable/disable auto-dismiss (default: true for success/warning/info, false for errors)
- `duration`: Time in milliseconds before auto-dismiss (default: 5000ms)
- `action`: Callback function for action button
- `actionLabel`: Text for action button

### 2. CSS Styles (`frontend/styles/main.css`)

**Notification Container:**
- Fixed position in top-right corner
- Z-index 3000 to appear above all content
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Pointer-events management for proper interaction

**Notification Cards:**
- Color-coded left border by type
- Icon display with SVG graphics
- Smooth animations using cubic-bezier easing
- Shadow and border-radius for modern look

**Responsive Behavior:**
- On mobile (<768px), notifications span full width with margins
- Proper stacking with gap spacing
- Touch-friendly close buttons

### 3. Integration Points

#### Distribution Claims (investor-portal.js)
```javascript
// When earnings are claimed successfully
window.notificationManager.success(
    `Successfully claimed ${response.amount} USDC from harvest distribution!`,
    {
        title: 'Earnings Claimed',
        duration: 7000
    }
);
```

#### Farmer Withdrawals (farmer-dashboard.js)
```javascript
// When withdrawal is processed
window.notificationManager.success(
    `Withdrawal of ${amount.toFixed(2)} USDC has been processed successfully.`,
    {
        title: 'Withdrawal Complete',
        duration: 7000
    }
);
```

#### Loan Health Warnings (investor-portal.js)
```javascript
// Critical health factor (< 1.1)
window.notificationManager.error(
    'Your loan health factor is critically low. Your collateral may be liquidated soon.',
    {
        title: 'ðŸš¨ Liquidation Risk',
        autoDismiss: false,
        action: () => this.showRepayLoanModal(),
        actionLabel: 'Repay Loan'
    }
);

// Warning health factor (1.1 - 1.2)
window.notificationManager.warning(
    `Your loan health factor is ${healthFactor.toFixed(2)}. Consider adding collateral.`,
    {
        title: 'Loan Health Warning',
        autoDismiss: false,
        action: () => this.showRepayLoanModal(),
        actionLabel: 'Manage Loan'
    }
);
```

#### Low Liquidity Alerts (investor-portal.js)
```javascript
// When pool utilization >= 90%
window.notificationManager.warning(
    `${pool.assetName} lending pool utilization is at ${utilizationRate.toFixed(1)}%. Limited liquidity available.`,
    {
        title: 'Low Liquidity Alert',
        autoDismiss: false,
        action: () => this.switchSection('lending'),
        actionLabel: 'View Pools'
    }
);
```
