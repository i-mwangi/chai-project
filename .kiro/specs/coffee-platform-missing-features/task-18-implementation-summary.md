# Task 18 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented integration with the CoffeePriceOracle contract, including backend API routes and contract interaction logic.

## Completed Subtasks

### 18.1 Add backend API routes for price oracle ✅

Created four new API endpoints in `api/server.ts`:

1. **GET `/api/pricing/coffee-prices`**
   - Parameters: `variety` (string), `grade` (number)
   - Returns: Coffee price for specific variety and grade
   - Includes mock mode fallback when contract not configured

2. **GET `/api/pricing/seasonal-price`**
   - Parameters: `variety` (string), `grade` (number), `month` (number)
   - Returns: Seasonally adjusted coffee price
   - Applies monthly multipliers to base prices

3. **POST `/api/pricing/projected-revenue`**
   - Body: `groveTokenAddress`, `variety`, `grade`, `expectedYieldKg`, `harvestMonth`
   - Returns: Projected revenue calculation based on yield and seasonal pricing
   - Includes price per kg breakdown

4. **POST `/api/pricing/validate-price`**
   - Body: `variety`, `grade`, `proposedPrice`, `harvestMonth` (optional)
   - Returns: Validation result with isValid flag and reason
   - Checks if price is within 50%-200% of market rate

All endpoints include:
- Proper error handling and validation
- Mock mode support for testing without contract
- Consistent response format with success flag

### 18.2 Implement contract interaction logic ✅

Created `api/price-oracle-contract.ts` with the `PriceOracleContract` class:

#### Core Contract Methods

1. **`getCoffeePrice(variety, grade)`**
   - Calls contract's `getCoffeePrice()` function
   - Returns base price for variety/grade combination
   - Implements 5-minute caching to reduce contract calls
   - Handles BigNumber conversion properly

2. **`getSeasonalCoffeePrice(variety, grade, month)`**
   - Calls contract's `getSeasonalCoffeePrice()` function
   - Returns seasonally adjusted price
   - Fetches seasonal multiplier for context

3. **`calculateProjectedRevenue(groveTokenAddress, variety, grade, expectedYieldKg, harvestMonth)`**
   - Calls contract's `calculateProjectedRevenue()` function
   - Returns projected revenue with detailed breakdown
   - Includes price per kg and all input parameters

4. **`getSeasonalMultiplier(month)`**
   - Queries contract's `seasonalMultipliers` mapping
   - Returns multiplier for specific month (scaled by 1000)
   - Defaults to 1.0x if not set

#### Additional Features

5. **`getCoffeePriceData(variety, grade)`**
   - Returns price with metadata (lastUpdated, isActive)
   - Useful for checking price staleness

6. **`validateSalePrice(variety, grade, proposedPrice, harvestMonth?)`**
   - Validates proposed price against market rates
   - Checks 50%-200% range
   - Returns validation result with suggested price

7. **`isPriceStale(variety, grade)`**
   - Checks if price data is >24 hours old
   - Returns boolean indicating staleness

8. **`getAllGradePrices(variety)`**
   - Fetches prices for all grades (1-10) of a variety
   - Returns Map of grade to price

9. **`getAllSeasonalMultipliers()`**
   - Fetches multipliers for all months (1-12)
   - Returns Map of month to multiplier

#### Price Caching Implementation

- Cache TTL: 5 minutes (300,000 ms)
- Cache key format: `${variety}-${grade}`
- Automatic cache invalidation on updates
- `clearCache()` method for manual refresh

#### Helper Functions

- `varietyNameToEnum(varietyName)` - Converts string to CoffeeVariety enum
- `varietyEnumToName(variety)` - Converts enum to readable string

#### Type Safety

All contract responses properly handle BigNumber types:
```typescript
const priceBigNum = result.getUint64(0)
const price = typeof priceBigNum === 'number' ? priceBigNum : Number(priceBigNum)
```

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 5.1: Display variety-specific prices ✅
- `getCoffeePrice()` fetches prices for ARABICA, ROBUSTA, SPECIALTY, ORGANIC
- API endpoint `/api/pricing/coffee-prices` exposes this functionality

### Requirement 5.2: Show quality grade pricing ✅
- All methods accept grade parameter (1-10 scale)
- Prices vary by grade level

### Requirement 5.4: Calculate projected revenue ✅
- `calculateProjectedRevenue()` applies variety, grade, and seasonal adjustments
- Returns complete breakdown of calculation

### Requirement 5.6: Validate sale price ✅
- `validateSalePrice()` checks against market rates
- Enforces 50%-200% range
- Provides suggested price

## Technical Implementation Details

### Contract Integration
- Uses Hedera SDK's `ContractCallQuery` for read operations
- Uses `ContractExecuteTransaction` for write operations (admin only)
- Proper gas limits set for each operation type
- Error handling with descriptive messages

### Data Conversion
- Prices stored as uint64 in contract (scaled by 1,000,000)
- Multipliers stored as uint64 (scaled by 1,000)
- Proper conversion to/from USDC decimal format

### Mock Mode Support
All endpoints work without contract configuration:
- Realistic mock prices for each variety
- Grade-based price multipliers (0.84x to 1.2x)
- Seasonal multipliers for harvest cycles
- Proper validation logic

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `api/price-oracle-contract.ts` - Contract interaction service (450+ lines)
- `test-pricing-endpoints.cjs` - Test script for API endpoints

### Modified
- `api/server.ts` - Added 4 new pricing API routes (~250 lines added)

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test-pricing-endpoints.cjs`) that verifies:
- All 4 API endpoints
- Parameter validation
- All coffee varieties
- Error handling

Tests can run in mock mode without contract deployment.

## Integration Points

The pricing system integrates with:
1. **Harvest Reporting** - Price validation during harvest submission
2. **Farmer Dashboard** - Display current market prices
3. **Revenue Calculation** - Use seasonal prices for distribution
4. **Grove Valuation** - Calculate projected returns

## Next Steps

To use the pricing system:

1. **Set environment variable:**
   ```
   COFFEE_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ID=0.0.YOUR_CONTRACT_ID
   ```

2. **Initialize prices (admin):**
   ```typescript
   await priceOracle.updateCoffeePrice(CoffeeVariety.ARABICA, 5, 4.50)
   ```

3. **Set seasonal multipliers (admin):**
   ```typescript
   await priceOracle.updateSeasonalMultiplier(6, 1200) // June = 1.2x
   ```

4. **Query prices:**
   ```typescript
   const price = await priceOracle.getCoffeePrice(CoffeeVariety.ARABICA, 5)
   ```
