## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Loading Loan Data:**
   - `loadSectionData('lending')` → `loadLoanData(investorAddress)`
   - Fetches portfolio value from API
   - Calculates max loan amount (holdings / 1.25)
   - Updates UI with loan availability
   - Checks for active loan

2. **Taking a Loan:**
   - User clicks "Take Out Loan" → `showTakeLoanModal()`
   - User enters amount → `updateLoanCalculations(amount)`
   - User confirms → `handleTakeLoan()`
   - API call → `coffeeAPI.takeOutLoan(assetAddress, loanAmount)`
   - Success → Refresh loan data → Show active loan

3. **Repaying a Loan:**
   - User clicks "Repay Loan" → `showRepayLoanModal()`
   - User confirms → `handleRepayLoan()`
   - API call → `coffeeAPI.repayLoan(assetAddress)`
   - Success → Clear active loan → Refresh UI

### Loan Calculations
- **Collateral Required:** `loanAmount * 1.25 / tokenPrice`
- **Liquidation Price:** `loanAmount / (collateralTokens * 0.90)`
- **Repayment Amount:** `loanAmount * 1.10`
- **Interest Amount:** `loanAmount * 0.10`
- **Health Factor:** `(collateralValue * 0.90) / loanAmount`

### API Integration
The implementation calls the following API methods (to be implemented in backend):
- `coffeeAPI.getPortfolio(investorAddress)` - Get holdings value
- `coffeeAPI.getLoanDetails(investorAddress, assetAddress)` - Get active loan
- `coffeeAPI.takeOutLoan(assetAddress, loanAmount)` - Process new loan
- `coffeeAPI.repayLoan(assetAddress)` - Repay active loan

### UI Components Added
1. **Loan Availability Card** - Shows max loan amount and terms
2. **Take Loan Modal** - Form to request a loan with calculations
3. **Active Loan Card** - Displays current loan details
4. **Loan Health Monitor** - Visual health factor display with warnings
5. **Repay Loan Modal** - Confirmation dialog for loan repayment

### Styling
Added comprehensive CSS in `frontend/styles/main.css`:
- Loan container and card layouts
- Health monitoring components
- Alert boxes (warning and critical)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Color-coded status indicators
- Gradient health bars
- Modal styling for loan forms

## Testing Recommendations

5. **Health Monitoring:**
   - Test health factor color coding at different values
   - Verify warning alerts appear at correct thresholds
   - Check health bar visual representation
   - Test responsive design on mobile devices
