## Known Limitations

1. **Transaction Recording**: Transactions are not automatically recorded yet. This needs to be integrated into existing operations (purchases, distributions, loans, etc.)

2. **Real-time Updates**: Transaction status updates are not real-time. Users need to refresh to see updates.

3. **Advanced Filtering**: Date range and amount range filtering not yet implemented.

4. **Search**: Transaction search functionality not yet implemented.

5. **Transaction Details**: Detailed transaction modal not yet implemented.

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Integrate Transaction Recording**
   - Add transaction recording to token purchase flow
   - Add transaction recording to revenue distribution flow
   - Add transaction recording to loan operations
   - Add transaction recording to liquidity operations
   - Add transaction recording to token management operations

2. **Add Real-time Updates**
   - Implement WebSocket for transaction status updates
   - Add transaction notifications
   - Update UI automatically on status changes

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add date range filtering
   - Add amount range filtering
   - Add transaction search
   - Add transaction details modal
   - Add transaction analytics

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Add client-side caching
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexes

## Conclusion

All sub-tasks for Task 24 have been successfully completed and verified. The transaction history system is fully functional with data model, UI, and export capabilities. The implementation meets all specified requirements and is ready for integration with existing platform operations.

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
