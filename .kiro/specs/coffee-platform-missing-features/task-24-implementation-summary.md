## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Model
```typescript
interface TransactionRecord {
    id: string;
    type: TransactionType;
    amount: number;
    asset: string;
    fromAddress: string;
    toAddress: string;
    status: TransactionStatus;
    timestamp: number;
    transactionHash: string;
    blockExplorerUrl: string;
    metadata: object;
}
```

### Database Schema
- Table: `transaction_history`
- Indexes on: fromAddress, toAddress, type, status, timestamp
- Composite index for user queries
- Metadata stored as JSON string

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/transactions/history?userAddress={address}` - Fetch transaction history
- `POST /api/transactions/save` - Save new transaction
- `PUT /api/transactions/update` - Update transaction status
- `GET /api/transactions/{id}` - Get transaction by ID

### Frontend Architecture
- `TransactionHistoryManager` class handles all transaction logic
- Integrated into both investor and farmer portals
- Lazy loading of transaction history module
- Pagination with configurable page size (20 items)
- Filter system for transaction types
- Real-time statistics calculation

## User Experience Features

### Investor Portal
- Accessible via "Transaction History" menu item
- Shows all transaction types relevant to investors
- Filter options: All, Purchases, Sales, Distributions, Loans, Liquidity operations
- Statistics: Total transactions, total volume, completed, pending

### Farmer Portal
- Accessible via "Transaction History" menu item
- Shows farmer-relevant transactions (distributions, withdrawals, sales)
- Filter options: All, Revenue Distributions, Withdrawals, Token Sales
- Statistics: Total transactions, total revenue, completed, pending

### Common Features
- Pagination with page numbers and prev/next buttons
- Export to CSV with timestamped filename
- Transaction status badges with color coding
- Direct links to Hedera HashScan block explorer
- Empty state messaging when no transactions found
- Loading states during data fetch

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- Integrates with wallet manager for user address
- Uses existing API client infrastructure
- Follows existing UI patterns and styling
- Compatible with balance poller for real-time updates

### Future Integration Opportunities

- Advanced filtering (date range, amount range)
- Transaction search functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Data Model Testing**
   - Test transaction record creation
   - Verify database schema and indexes
   - Test API endpoints with various parameters

2. **UI Testing**

   - Test CSV export with various filters
   - Check responsive design on mobile devices

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test transaction recording during actual operations
   - Verify transaction status updates
   - Test with multiple user roles (farmer, investor, admin)

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with large transaction datasets (1000+ transactions)
   - Verify pagination performance
   - Test filter and search performance
