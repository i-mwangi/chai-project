# Task 14 Implementation Summary

## Task: Implement Price Oracle API endpoints

### Status: ✅ Completed

## Implementation Details

### Subtask 14.1: Add price fetching endpoints to api.js
**Status:** ✅ Completed

Added the following methods to the `CoffeeTreeAPI` class:

1. **`getCoffeePrices(variety, grade)`**
   - Fetches coffee prices for a specific variety and grade
   - Uses GET request with query parameters
   - Endpoint: `/api/pricing/coffee-prices`

2. **`getSeasonalPrice(variety, grade, month)`**
   - Fetches seasonal price for a specific variety, grade, and month
   - Uses POST request with body parameters
   - Endpoint: `/api/pricing/seasonal-price`

3. **`getAllVarietyPrices()`**
   - Fetches prices for all coffee varieties
   - Uses GET request
   - Endpoint: `/api/pricing/all-variety-prices`

4. **`getSeasonalMultipliers()`**
   - Fetches seasonal multipliers for all months
   - Uses GET request
   - Endpoint: `/api/pricing/seasonal-multipliers`

### Subtask 14.2: Add price calculation endpoints to api.js
**Status:** ✅ Completed

Added the following methods to the `CoffeeTreeAPI` class:

1. **`calculateProjectedRevenue(variety, grade, yieldKg, harvestMonth)`**
   - Calculates projected revenue based on variety, grade, yield, and harvest month
   - Uses POST request with body parameters
   - Endpoint: `/api/pricing/projected-revenue`

2. **`validateSalePrice(variety, grade, proposedPrice)`**
   - Validates a proposed sale price against market rates
   - Uses POST request with body parameters
   - Endpoint: `/api/pricing/validate-price`

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **Requirement 5.1**: Display prices for each variety (Arabica, Robusta, Specialty, Organic)
- ✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Show quality grade pricing (1-10 scale)
- ✅ **Requirement 5.3**: Display monthly price multipliers
- ✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Apply variety, grade, and seasonal adjustments for projected revenue
- ✅ **Requirement 5.6**: Validate sale price against market rates (50%-200% range)

## Code Location

- **File Modified**: `frontend/js/api.js`
- **Lines Added**: ~40 lines
- **Section**: Price Oracle API methods (added after Lending Pool API methods)

## API Endpoints Expected

The following backend API endpoints need to be implemented to support these methods:

### Price Fetching Endpoints
- `GET /api/pricing/coffee-prices?variety={variety}&grade={grade}`
- `POST /api/pricing/seasonal-price` (body: {variety, grade, month})
- `GET /api/pricing/all-variety-prices`
- `GET /api/pricing/seasonal-multipliers`

### Price Calculation Endpoints
- `POST /api/pricing/projected-revenue` (body: {variety, grade, yieldKg, harvestMonth})
- `POST /api/pricing/validate-price` (body: {variety, grade, proposedPrice})

## Testing Notes

- All methods follow the existing API pattern using the `request()` utility method
- Error handling is inherited from the base `request()` method
- No syntax errors detected in the implementation
- Methods are ready to be used by the PriceOracleManager class (Task 15)

## Next Steps

The next task (Task 15) will implement the Price Oracle core logic that uses these API endpoints to:
- Fetch and cache price data
- Calculate projected revenue with variety, grade, and seasonal adjustments
- Validate sale prices against market rates
- Detect stale price data
