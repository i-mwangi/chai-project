# Task 12 Implementation Summary: Integrate with Lender Contract

## Overview
Successfully implemented backend API integration with the Lender smart contract, including all lending pool operations and loan management functionality.

## Completed Subtasks

### 12.1 Add backend API routes for lending pools ✅
Created the following endpoints in `api/server.ts`:

1. **GET /api/lending/pools**
   - Returns list of available lending pools
   - Includes pool statistics and APY information

2. **POST /api/lending/provide-liquidity**
   - Accepts: `{ assetAddress, amount }`
   - Provides liquidity to a lending pool
   - Returns LP token amount and transaction hash

3. **POST /api/lending/withdraw-liquidity**
   - Accepts: `{ assetAddress, lpTokenAmount }`
   - Withdraws liquidity from a lending pool
   - Burns LP tokens and returns USDC

4. **GET /api/lending/pool-stats**
   - Query params: `assetAddress`
   - Returns detailed pool statistics:
     - Total liquidity
     - Available liquidity
     - Total borrowed
     - Utilization rate
     - Current APY

### 12.2 Add backend API routes for loans ✅
Created the following endpoints in `api/server.ts`:

1. **POST /api/lending/calculate-loan-terms**
   - Accepts: `{ assetAddress, loanAmount }`
   - Calculates loan terms including:
     - Collateral required (125% ratio)
     - Liquidation price (90% threshold)
     - Repayment amount (110% of loan)
     - Interest rate

2. **POST /api/lending/take-loan**
   - Accepts: `{ assetAddress, loanAmount }`
   - Takes out a loan against collateral
   - Locks collateral and transfers KES
   - Returns loan details and transaction hash

3. **POST /api/lending/repay-loan**
   - Accepts: `{ assetAddress }`
   - Repays outstanding loan
   - Unlocks collateral
   - Returns transaction hash

4. **GET /api/lending/loan-details**
   - Query params: `borrowerAddress, assetAddress`
   - Returns loan details:
     - Loan amount in KES
     - Collateral amount
     - Liquidation price
     - Repayment amount
     - Loan status (outstanding, liquidated, repaid)

### 12.3 Implement contract interaction logic ✅
Created `api/lender-contract.ts` with the `LenderContract` class:

#### Core Methods Implemented:

1. **provideLiquidity(assetAddress, amount)**
   - Calls `provideLiquidity()` on Lender contract
   - Transfers KES to pool
   - Mints LP tokens to provider
   - Returns transaction result

2. **withdrawLiquidity(assetAddress, lpTokenAmount)**
   - Calls `withdrawLiquidity()` on Lender contract
   - Burns LP tokens
   - Returns KES plus rewards
   - Handles transaction errors

3. **takeOutLoan(assetAddress, loanAmount)**
   - Calls `takeOutLoan()` on Lender contract
   - Calculates collateral requirements (125% ratio)
   - Locks collateral tokens
   - Transfers loan amount in KES
   - Records loan details

4. **repayOutstandingLoan(assetAddress)**
   - Calls `repayOutstandingLoan()` on Lender contract
   - Transfers repayment amount (110% of loan)
   - Unlocks collateral
   - Updates loan status

#### Helper Methods:

- **getLpTokenAddress(assetAddress)** - Gets LP token address for a pool
- **getReserveAddress(assetAddress)** - Gets reserve contract address
- **getLoanDetails(assetAddress, borrowerAddress)** - Queries loan information
- **getPoolStatistics(assetAddress)** - Gets pool metrics
- **calculateLoanTerms(assetAddress, loanAmount)** - Calculates loan parameters
- **getLendingPools()** - Lists all available pools

#### Utility Functions:

- **calculateLoanHealth(collateralValue, loanAmount, currentPrice)** - Calculates health factor
- **isLoanAtRisk(healthFactor)** - Checks if loan health < 1.2
- **shouldLiquidate(healthFactor)** - Checks if loan health < 1.0

## Technical Implementation Details

### Contract Integration Pattern
Following the same pattern as `revenue-reserve-contract.ts`:
- Uses Hedera SDK for contract interactions
- Implements proper error handling
- Returns structured result objects
- Supports both mock mode and real contract calls

### Error Handling
All endpoints include:
- Input validation
- Contract call error handling
- Structured error responses
- Transaction failure handling

### Mock Mode Support
All endpoints support mock mode when `LENDER_CONTRACT_ID` is not configured:
- Returns realistic mock data
- Enables frontend testing without deployed contracts
- Includes `mockMode: true` flag in responses

### Data Types
Properly handles Hedera-specific types:
- Converts amounts to uint64 format
- Handles address conversions
- Parses contract query results
- Converts BigNumber to number types

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 3.1** - Display lending pool details (APY, TVL, capacity)
✅ **Requirement 3.2** - Provide liquidity and mint LP tokens
✅ **Requirement 3.3** - Withdraw liquidity and burn LP tokens
✅ **Requirement 3.5** - View pool statistics

✅ **Requirement 4.1** - Display available loan amount based on collateral
✅ **Requirement 4.2** - Take out loans with collateral locking
✅ **Requirement 4.4** - Repay loans and unlock collateral

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `api/lender-contract.ts` - Lender contract interaction service (450+ lines)

### Modified:
- `api/server.ts` - Added 8 new lending/loan endpoints (400+ lines added)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests** (to be added in future tasks):
   - Test loan term calculations
   - Test collateral ratio calculations
   - Test health factor calculations
   - Test error handling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test full liquidity provision flow
   - Test loan lifecycle (take → monitor → repay)
   - Test batch operations
   - Test error scenarios

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test with mock mode enabled
   - Verify API responses match expected format
   - Test error cases (invalid inputs, insufficient balance)
   - Test with real contract (when deployed)

## Next Steps

The lending contract integration is now complete. The frontend can now:
1. Display available lending pools
2. Allow users to provide/withdraw liquidity
3. Calculate and display loan terms
4. Enable users to take out and repay loans
5. Monitor loan health and liquidation risk

The next task (13) will implement the Advanced Pricing Module foundation.

## Notes

- All endpoints support both mock mode and real contract mode
- Contract interactions follow Hedera best practices
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- Code follows existing patterns from revenue distribution implementation
- Ready for frontend integration (tasks 10-11 already completed)
