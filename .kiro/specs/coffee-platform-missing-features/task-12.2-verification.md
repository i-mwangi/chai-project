## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All four required loan management endpoints have been successfully implemented in `api/server.ts`.

### 1. Calculate Loan Terms Endpoint
**Location:** `api/server.ts` lines 963-1020
**Method:** POST
**Path:** `/api/lending/calculate-loan-terms`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "assetAddress": "string",
  "loanAmount": number
}
```

**Response:**
```json

- Proper error handling

**Requirements Met:** 4.2 (take out loan functionality)

### 3. Repay Loan Endpoint
**Location:** `api/server.ts` lines 1073-1111
**Method:** POST
**Path:** `/api/lending/repay-loan`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "assetAddress": "string"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Loan repaid successfully",
  "transactionHash": "string"
}
```

**Features:**
- Validates required parameter (assetAddress)
- Integrates with LenderContract service
- Returns transaction hash
- Supports mock mode when contract not configured
- Proper error handling

**Requirements Met:** 4.4 (loan repayment functionality)

### 4. Loan Details Endpoint
**Location:** `api/server.ts` lines 1111-1160
**Method:** GET
**Path:** `/api/lending/loan-details`

**Query Parameters:**
- `borrowerAddress`: string (required)
- `assetAddress`: string (required)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "loan": {
    "loanAmountKES": number,
    "collateralAmountAsset": number,
    "liquidationKESPrice": number,
    "repayAmountKES": number,
    "isLiquidated": boolean,
    "isRepaid": boolean,
    "isOutstanding": boolean
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- Validates required parameters (borrowerAddress, assetAddress)
- Integrates with LenderContract service
- Returns complete loan details
- Supports mock mode when contract not configured
- Proper error handling

**Requirements Met:** 4.4 (view loan details)

## Integration with LenderContract

All endpoints properly integrate with the `LenderContract` service from `api/lender-contract.ts`:

- `calculateLoanTerms()` - Calculates collateral, liquidation price, and repayment
- `takeOutLoan()` - Executes loan transaction on smart contract
- `repayOutstandingLoan()` - Executes repayment transaction
- `getLoanDetails()` - Queries loan status from contract

## Error Handling

All endpoints implement comprehensive error handling:
- ✅ Parameter validation (400 Bad Request)
- ✅ Business logic validation (400 Bad Request)
- ✅ Contract interaction errors (500 Internal Server Error)
- ✅ Detailed error messages for debugging
- ✅ Graceful fallback to mock mode when contract not configured

## Mock Mode Support

All endpoints support mock mode for testing when `LENDER_CONTRACT_ID` is not configured:
- Returns realistic mock data
- Includes `mockMode: true` flag in response
- Allows frontend development without deployed contracts

## Requirements Mapping

| Requirement | Description | Implementation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 4.1 | Display available loan amount with 125% collateralization | ✅ `/api/lending/calculate-loan-terms` |
| 4.2 | Take out loan, lock collateral, transfer USDC | ✅ `/api/lending/take-loan` |
| 4.4 | Repay loan and view loan details | ✅ `/api/lending/repay-loan` + `/api/lending/loan-details` |

## Testing

Test file exists at `test-lending-endpoints.js` with comprehensive tests for all four endpoints.

To run tests:
```bash
node test-lending-endpoints.js
```

## Conclusion

Task 12.2 is **COMPLETE**. All four required backend API routes for loan management have been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Proper request/response handling
- ✅ Parameter validation
- ✅ Integration with LenderContract service
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Mock mode support for testing
- ✅ All requirements (4.1, 4.2, 4.4) satisfied
