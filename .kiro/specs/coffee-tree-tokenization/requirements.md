# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing tokenized asset platform into a coffee tree investment ecosystem on Hedera blockchain. The platform will enable investors to purchase digital tokens representing ownership stakes in coffee trees, while providing farmers with upfront capital and transparent revenue sharing from coffee sales. Each coffee tree token represents a fractional ownership in a specific coffee tree or grove, with smart contracts managing the revenue distribution from coffee harvests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to purchase coffee tree tokens representing ownership stakes in specific coffee trees, so that I can earn passive income from coffee sales while supporting sustainable farming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an investor browses available coffee trees THEN the system SHALL display tree details including location, age, variety, expected yield, and price per token
2. WHEN an investor purchases coffee tree tokens THEN the system SHALL transfer the specified amount of USDC from the investor to the farmer's reserve AND mint the corresponding tree tokens to the investor's wallet
3. WHEN a purchase is completed THEN the system SHALL emit a TreeTokenPurchased event with tree ID, token amount, investor address, and purchase price
4. IF insufficient tree tokens are available THEN the system SHALL reject the purchase AND display available quantity
5. WHEN an investor views their portfolio THEN the system SHALL display all owned tree tokens with current value and projected returns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a coffee farmer, I want to tokenize my coffee trees to receive upfront funding, so that I can invest in better farming equipment and practices while maintaining ownership of my land.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer registers their coffee grove THEN the system SHALL create a new tokenized tree asset with specified details (location, tree count, variety, expected yield)
2. WHEN tree tokenization is complete THEN the system SHALL mint the total supply of tree tokens AND transfer them to the farmer's control
3. WHEN investors purchase tokens THEN the system SHALL transfer USDC payments to the farmer's designated wallet address
4. WHEN a farmer lists their trees THEN the system SHALL require verification of tree ownership, location coordinates, and farming credentials
5. IF tokenization fails THEN the system SHALL revert all changes AND notify the farmer of the specific error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a coffee farmer, I want to report harvest yields and sales data, so that token holders receive their proportional share of coffee revenue automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer reports a harvest THEN the system SHALL record harvest weight, quality grade, sale price, and harvest date
2. WHEN harvest data is submitted THEN the system SHALL calculate total revenue AND determine the revenue share percentage for token holders
3. WHEN revenue distribution is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically transfer USDC proportionally to all token holders based on their ownership percentage
4. WHEN revenue is distributed THEN the system SHALL emit a RevenueDistributed event with harvest ID, total revenue, and distribution details
5. IF harvest reporting fails validation THEN the system SHALL reject the submission AND provide specific error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a token holder, I want to receive automatic revenue distributions from coffee sales, so that I earn passive income without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coffee revenue is available for distribution THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate each token holder's share based on their token ownership percentage
2. WHEN revenue distribution occurs THEN the system SHALL transfer USDC directly to token holders' wallets without requiring any action from them
3. WHEN a distribution is complete THEN the system SHALL update each token holder's earnings history AND send notification of the payment
4. WHEN token holders check their earnings THEN the system SHALL display total earnings, distribution history, and projected future returns
5. IF a distribution fails THEN the system SHALL retry the transaction AND log the failure for manual resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to verify farmer credentials and tree ownership, so that only legitimate coffee operations can tokenize their trees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer applies for tokenization THEN the system SHALL require submission of land ownership documents, farming licenses, and tree location verification
2. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL grant the farmer permission to tokenize their trees AND issue a verified farmer badge
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the account for manual review AND temporarily suspend tokenization privileges
4. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific reasons for rejection AND allow the farmer to resubmit corrected documentation
5. IF fraudulent activity is confirmed THEN the system SHALL permanently ban the farmer account AND notify relevant authorities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an investor, I want to trade my coffee tree tokens on a secondary market, so that I can exit my investment or adjust my portfolio allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an investor wants to sell tree tokens THEN the system SHALL allow them to list tokens at their desired price on the marketplace
2. WHEN another investor purchases listed tokens THEN the system SHALL transfer tokens to the buyer AND transfer USDC to the seller
3. WHEN a trade is executed THEN the system SHALL update ownership records AND emit a TokenTraded event with trade details
4. WHEN investors browse the marketplace THEN the system SHALL display available tokens with tree details, current yield data, and asking prices
5. IF a trade fails THEN the system SHALL revert all changes AND notify both parties of the failure reason

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a coffee farmer, I want to access transparent pricing data and market information, so that I can make informed decisions about coffee sales and revenue sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer views market data THEN the system SHALL display current coffee prices, historical trends, and regional market information
2. WHEN coffee prices are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust revenue calculations for future harvests
3. WHEN a farmer reports sales THEN the system SHALL validate sale prices against current market rates AND flag significant deviations
4. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL notify farmers of opportunities to optimize their sales timing
5. IF price data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use the last known price AND display a warning about data freshness

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a token holder, I want to monitor the health and productivity of my invested coffee trees, so that I can make informed decisions about my investment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token holders access tree monitoring THEN the system SHALL display real-time data including tree health, growth stage, weather conditions, and care activities
2. WHEN farmers update tree status THEN the system SHALL record maintenance activities, treatments applied, and health assessments
3. WHEN environmental risks are detected THEN the system SHALL notify token holders of potential impacts to yield or tree health
4. WHEN harvest season approaches THEN the system SHALL provide yield projections based on tree condition and historical data
5. IF monitoring data is missing THEN the system SHALL request updates from farmers AND display data freshness indicators
