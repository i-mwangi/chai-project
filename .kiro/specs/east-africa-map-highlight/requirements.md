# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modifies the existing world map SVG to highlight only three East African countries: Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. The goal is to create a focused visual representation that draws attention to these specific countries while maintaining the context of the world map.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the map, I want to see Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia visually highlighted, so that I can immediately identify these countries on the world map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SVG map is rendered THEN Kenya SHALL be visually distinct from other countries
2. WHEN the SVG map is rendered THEN Uganda SHALL be visually distinct from other countries
3. WHEN the SVG map is rendered THEN Ethiopia SHALL be visually distinct from other countries
4. WHEN the SVG map is rendered THEN all other countries SHALL have a neutral or subdued appearance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the highlighted countries to use a consistent styling approach, so that the visual treatment is uniform and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling is applied to the three countries THEN they SHALL use the same color scheme
2. WHEN styling is applied THEN the implementation SHALL use CSS classes or inline styles consistently
3. IF the SVG uses path elements for countries THEN the styling SHALL be applied to the correct path elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the non-highlighted countries to remain visible but subdued, so that I maintain geographic context while focusing on the highlighted region.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map is displayed THEN non-highlighted countries SHALL remain visible
2. WHEN the map is displayed THEN non-highlighted countries SHALL have reduced visual prominence compared to highlighted countries
3. WHEN the map is displayed THEN the contrast between highlighted and non-highlighted countries SHALL be clear

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to correctly identify the SVG path elements for Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia, so that the modifications target the correct geographic regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the SVG file THEN the path elements for Kenya SHALL be correctly identified
2. WHEN examining the SVG file THEN the path elements for Uganda SHALL be correctly identified
3. WHEN examining the SVG file THEN the path elements for Ethiopia SHALL be correctly identified
4. IF country paths have ID or class attributes THEN these SHALL be used for identification
