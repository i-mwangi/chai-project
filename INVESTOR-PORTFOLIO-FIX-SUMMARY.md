# Investor Portfolio Display Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Health Score Showing as Undefined ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The health score was not being displayed in the investor's portfolio holdings list.

**Root Cause**: 
- The API (`api/investment-api.ts`) was correctly returning `currentHealthScore` in the portfolio response
- However, the frontend `renderHoldings()` function in `investor-portal.js` was not extracting or displaying this value

**Fix Applied**:
- Added code to extract `currentHealthScore` from the holding data
- Falls back to `healthScore` or `0` if not available
- Displays the health score with appropriate color coding (green/yellow/red) using the existing `getHealthClass()` method

### 2. Location Tag (Blue/Purple Bar) Not Displaying ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The location information was not being shown next to grove groupings in the portfolio.

**Root Cause**:
- The API was returning `location` and `coffeeVariety` fields
- The frontend was not rendering these fields in the holdings display
- The CSS classes `.location-tag` and `.variety-tag` existed but weren't being used

**Fix Applied**:
- Added a `grove-meta` section to display:
  - Coffee variety tag (blue background)
  - Location tag (purple background) - this is the "blue bar" you were asking about
  - Health indicator with score

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `frontend/js/investor-portal.js`

**Function**: `renderHoldings()` (lines ~741-775)

**Added Code**:
```javascript
// Get health score and location from holding data
const healthScore = holding.currentHealthScore || holding.healthScore || 0;
const location = holding.location || 'Unknown';
const coffeeVariety = holding.coffeeVariety || 'Unknown';
```

**Added HTML Section**:
```html
<div class="grove-meta" style="margin: 10px 0; display: flex; gap: 8px; align-items: center;">
    <span class="variety-tag">${coffeeVariety}</span>
    <span class="location-tag">${location}</span>
    <div class="health-indicator">
        <span class="health-score ${this.getHealthClass(healthScore)}">
            ${healthScore}
        </span>
        <small>Health Score</small>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Visual Result

Each holding in the investor portfolio now displays:
1. **Variety Tag** (blue): Shows the coffee variety (e.g., "Arabica", "Robusta")
2. **Location Tag** (purple): Shows the grove location (e.g., "Costa Rica", "Colombia") - **This is the blue/purple bar you mentioned**
3. **Health Score**: Shows the numerical health score with color coding:
   - Green (≥80): Excellent health
   - Yellow (60-79): Good health  
   - Red (<60): Needs attention

## Data Flow

```
Database (coffeeGroves table)
  ↓ (includes currentHealthScore, location, coffeeVariety)
API Endpoint (/api/investment/portfolio)
  ↓ (returns these fields in portfolio.holdings)
Frontend (investor-portal.js)
  ↓ (now extracts and displays these fields)
User Interface
  ✅ Health score visible
  ✅ Location tag (purple bar) visible
  ✅ Coffee variety tag visible
```

## Testing

2. Log in as an investor
3. Navigate to the Portfolio section
4. Check that each holding now shows:
   - Coffee variety tag (blue)
   - Location tag (purple)
   - Health score with number
