# Notification System Fixes

## Issue
When connecting a wallet, the notification card pops out but no message is displayed.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Container ID Mismatch**: The NotificationManager was looking for `notification-container` but app.html had `toastContainer`
2. **Missing Error Handling**: Wallet connection errors weren't being displayed in notifications
3. **Initialization Issues**: Notification system might not be properly initialized in all contexts

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Container ID Detection
**File**: `frontend/js/notification-manager.js`
- Updated the `init()` method to check for both `notification-container` and `toastContainer` IDs
- Added debug logging to help identify initialization issues

### 2. Enhanced Wallet Manager Notifications
**File**: `frontend/wallet/manager.js`
- Improved `showToast()` method to properly handle different notification types
- Added string conversion for messages to prevent type errors
- Added fallback alert for error debugging in localhost

### 3. Enhanced Wallet Modal Error Handling
**File**: `frontend/wallet/modal.js`
- Updated `showError()` method to display errors through the notification system
- Added proper fallback to console logging if notification system is unavailable

### 4. Added Notification System Initialization Check
**File**: `frontend/js/main.js`
- Added DOMContentLoaded event to ensure notification manager exists
- Added fallback initialization if the manager is missing

## Testing
Created test files to verify the notification system works:
- `frontend/test-notification.html` - Basic notification testing
- `frontend/test-notification-console.html` - Console-based testing
- `frontend/notification-test.html` - Comprehensive testing with wallet manager simulation

## How to Test
1. Open `frontend/notification-test.html` in a browser
2. Click the various test buttons to verify notifications appear
3. Check browser console for debug messages
4. Test wallet connection simulation

## Verification
The fixes ensure that:
1. Notifications will display regardless of container ID used
2. Wallet connection errors are properly shown to users
3. The notification system is properly initialized
4. Fallback mechanisms exist for debugging
