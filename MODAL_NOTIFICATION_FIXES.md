# Modal and Notification Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Modal Overlay Problem**: The grove registration modal didn't have a proper overlay, and the wallet modal's overlay had `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` which blurred the background including notifications.

2. **Notification Visibility**: Notifications were not visible when modals were open because they appeared behind the modal overlay or were blurred by the backdrop filter.

3. **Modal Close Functionality**: The grove registration modal didn't have proper event listeners for closing when clicking the overlay or pressing Escape.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Proper Modal Overlay to Grove Registration Modal

**File**: `frontend/app.html`

- Added `<div class="modal-overlay"></div>` inside the grove registration modal
- This provides a proper overlay without the blurring effect

### 2. Fixed Modal CSS

**File**: `frontend/css/forms.css`

- Added comprehensive modal styles including overlay, content, header, and close button
- Removed `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` to prevent blurring notifications
- Added proper z-index values to ensure correct layering

### 3. Updated Wallet Modal CSS

**File**: `frontend/wallet/modal.css`

- Commented out `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` to prevent blurring notifications
- Added `z-index: 10001` to the modal content

### 4. Enhanced Notification Z-Index

**File**: `frontend/css/notifications.css`

- Increased z-index to `10002` to ensure notifications appear above all modals
- Added `!important` flags to override any conflicting styles

### 5. Improved Modal JavaScript

**File**: `frontend/js/farmer-dashboard.js`

- Added `closeModals()` method to properly close all modals
- Enhanced `setupEventListeners()` to add event listeners for:
  - Modal close buttons
  - Modal overlays (clicking outside modal content)
  - Cancel buttons
  - Escape key to close modals
- Added proper event listener cleanup to prevent duplicates

### 6. Testing

**File**: `frontend/modal-notification-test.html`

- Created a test file to verify that modals and notifications work correctly together
- Includes tests for opening modals, showing notifications, and ensuring visibility

## How It Works Now

1. When the grove registration modal is opened, it has a semi-transparent overlay without blurring
2. Notifications appear at the top right with a higher z-index than modals
3. Users can see notifications even when modals are open
4. Modals can be closed by:
   - Clicking the close button (Ã—)
   - Clicking outside the modal content on the overlay
   - Pressing the Escape key
5. All event listeners are properly managed to prevent memory leaks

## Verification

These fixes ensure that:
1. Notifications are always visible when modals are open
2. Modal overlays don't blur the background
3. Users can easily close modals using multiple methods
4. Proper event listener management prevents memory leaks
5. Z-index layering is consistent across all UI components
