# 🎯 FINAL FIX - Primary Market Investment Issue

## The Root Cause

The system was using an **in-memory mock database** instead of the real SQLite database because `DISABLE_INVESTOR_KYC=true` was set in the `.env` file. This meant:
- ❌ No data was persisted to disk
- ❌ All purchases were lost when servers restarted
- ❌ Portfolio couldn't show any investments

## The Solution

I've made the following fixes:

### 1. ✅ Changed Database to Real SQLite
- Updated `.env` file: `DISABLE_INVESTOR_KYC=false`
- This enables the real SQLite database that persists data

### 2. ✅ Fixed Frontend Proxy
- Updated `frontend/api-server.js` to proxy these endpoints to the backend:
  - `/api/investment/purchase-tokens` - Token purchases
  - `/api/investment/portfolio` - Portfolio retrieval
  - `/api/farmer-verification/register-grove` - Grove registration
  - `/api/investment/available-groves` - Available groves list

### 3. ✅ Fixed Type Conversion
- Updated `api/investment-api.ts` to handle grove ID as string or integer

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Both Servers

**Stop all running servers first**, then:

**Terminal 1 - Backend API:**
```bash
tsx api/server.ts
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Mock Server:**
```bash
node frontend/api-server.js
```

### Step 2: Verify Everything Works

Run the test script:
```bash
npx tsx debug-portfolio.ts
```

You should see:
```
📊 Analysis:
✅ SUCCESS: Purchase is in both backend database and frontend!
```

### Step 3: Test in Your Browser

1. **Register a Grove** (as farmer)
   - Go to farmer portal
   - Register a new grove

2. **Purchase Tokens** (as investor)
   - Go to investor portal
   - View available groves
   - Click "Invest" on a grove
   - Enter token amount
   - Click "Purchase"

3. **Check Portfolio**
   - Go to "My Portfolio"
   - You should see your purchase!

## ✅ What's Fixed

After restarting both servers with the new configuration:

- ✅ Purchases are saved to SQLite database
- ✅ Data persists across server restarts
- ✅ Portfolio shows all your investments
- ✅ Primary market purchases work exactly like secondary market
- ✅ Revenue distributions will include your holdings
- ✅ You can list your tokens on the secondary marketplace

## 🔍 Verification Commands

**Check database type:**
```bash
npx tsx check-db-type.ts
```
Should show: "✅ Using real SQLite database"

**Check servers are running:**
```bash
npx tsx check-servers.ts
```
Should show both servers running

**Check groves in database:**
```bash
npx tsx check-database-groves.ts
```
Should show groves after you register them

**Full end-to-end test:**
```bash
npx tsx debug-portfolio.ts
```
Should show successful purchase and portfolio retrieval

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Both servers must be restarted** to pick up the `.env` change
2. **The backend must be on port 3001** and frontend on port 3002
3. **Previous test data is lost** because it was in memory - start fresh
4. **Database file location**: `./local-store/sqlite/sqlite.db` (will be created automatically)

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ You can purchase tokens from a grove
- ✅ The purchase appears in your portfolio immediately
- ✅ After restarting servers, your portfolio still shows the purchase
- ✅ You can see the purchase in the database using the check script

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Grove not found" error
- Make sure both servers are restarted
- Check that `DISABLE_INVESTOR_KYC=false` in `.env`
- Verify backend is using real database: `npx tsx check-db-type.ts`

### Portfolio is empty
- Check if purchase was successful (should see success message)
- Verify servers are running: `npx tsx check-servers.ts`
- Check database has groves: `npx tsx check-database-groves.ts`

### Servers won't start
- Check if ports 3001 and 3002 are available
- Kill any existing processes on those ports
- Check for syntax errors in the modified files

## 🔄 Quick Restart Script

If you need to restart servers quickly:
```bash
# Stop and restart frontend only
.\restart-frontend-server.bat

# Stop and restart both servers
.\restart-all-servers.bat
```

---

**Once both servers are restarted, your primary market investment feature will be fully functional!** 🎉
